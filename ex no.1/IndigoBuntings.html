One of the most vibrant blue birds in the Eastern United States, the Indigo Bunting is hard to miss as it flutters along a roadside or perches on power lines. Only males have the characteristic blue feathers, females are a nondescript brown. Spot Indigo Buntings during the summer months throughout all of the Eastern United States. Females do all the work of making the nest and raising the chicks, so she’s harder to spot. Indigo Buntings are one type of songbird that migrates at night!  </p>
